1. Create a shell script that:
   a) builds todo-manager (source code in app directory)
   b) runs 3 instances of todo-manager on ports 3001, 3002, 3003
   c) the instances must share the DB (which is located in /etc/todos)
   d) every hour backups the DB content to the host

Hints:
   c) create volume todo-vol, and attach it to all three containers
   d) for backup, use `docker cp` command
Verify that database is shared by testing all 3 instances in the browser.

2. To prove that backup is set correctly, create another shell script that:
   a) destroys todo-vol
   b) recreates volume todo-vol
   c) restore data from backup


USEFUL COMMANDS FROM PRESENTATION:
docker run -d --name testing --mount source=my-vol,target=/app ubuntu
docker run -dp 5000:3000 new_todo
