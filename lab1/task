1. Create image named 'hello' that prints 'Hello World!' if you run: docker run hello.
   Constraints:
    - as a base image, you must use python https://hub.docker.com/_/python?tab=description
    - script hello.py (from this repository) must print the statement
    - Dockerfile for your image must include instruction FROM, WORKDIR, COPY, ENTRYPOINT, CMD
   Hint: in bash, python script is run like `python3 hello.py`

2. Create image named 'test_arg:<username>.<group>', tagged with two different usernames and groups.
   Pass <username> and <group> as ARG to the builder. 
   Copy file hello.py to the image and change owner of the file to <username> and sets group.

   docker run test_arg:<username> must list the file (ls -l) to show owner and group was set correctly.
   As a base image, use UBUNTU.
